# Diabetes Data Tracking
---------------------------------------------------

In this project I am trying to create an interface in which I can enter the data I collect about my blood sugar easily. I chose a blood sugar monitor that didn't have an app specifically so I could create a project like this.

#### The project objectives 

- Challenge myself to build a data pipeline from scratch
- build upon current ability in SQL
- create a simple tool that I can use to reference data about my health with a few simple commands 

##### Tools I'm using

- Python 
	+ pandas
	+ matplotlib
	+ sqlite3
	+ discord
- SQL
- Discord
- Jupyter Notebooks

##### (Pipeline) Dreams for future versions of project

- I would like to be able to request certain kinds of graphs with customized commands on discord and have a graph returned to me as a ping (blood sugar for the day, week, compared to last week, etc.)
- create additional databases to cross analyze information, what food I'm eating, [emotions tracking](https://github.com/mctopherganesh/emotions_tracking)


##### Quick summary on process so far

I waited a little long to start this project as it was bouncing around in my head since my diagnoses so I had to build a tool to enter the data from my blood sugar monitor (which keeps every test) by hand (well )
